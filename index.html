            <h2>A bit of a background story...</h2>
            <p>Born and raised in the Philippines, I made the move to the United States in 2012. However, due to the difference in educational systems, I had to start junior high school again as my high school diploma from the Philippines wasn't accepted. After two years of high school in the US, I enrolled in a local community college for pre-nursing.
            <br>
            <br>
            A year later, my father, realizing the financial challenges of sending me to college, inquired with the military recruiting office about my eligibility to join. Considering my options, I chose the Navy due to my preference for their uniform. Initially hesitant, mainly because I couldn't swim which my father thought was ridiculous commenting "it's not like the Air Force can fly themselves", I eventually made the decision to join, understanding the opportunities it could provide.
            <br>
            <br>
            In February 2016, I underwent the rigors of boot camp, an experience that, while I may find foolish now, taught me valuable lessons. After eight weeks, I spent three weeks in Great Lakes, Chicago, learning basic seamanship before being sent to San Diego, California, to join my ship, DDG-102. Shortly after, I embarked on a deployment to the South Pacific, traveling as far as New Zealand and Antarctica. In New Zealand, we engaged in humanitarian efforts following the devastating 2016 Kaik≈çura earthquake.
            <br>
            <br>
            After returning from that deployment, I spent a few months in Everett, Washington, before setting out on another deployment, this time to the Pacific and the Middle East. Upon returning to Washington, I finally decided to get a bilateral bunionectomy due to occuring problems, which led to a shore duty rotation of five months. I was then reassigned to a different ship, DDG-101, and embarked on another eventful deployment. We journeyed to the Caribbean, New York, Nova Scotia, and various parts of Europe, including an unforgettable 14-day visit to Norway for our NATO tour.
            <br>
            <br>    
            Following the deployment, the COVID-19 pandemic struck, allowing me to remain on the mainland for a year before preparing for another deployment. However, due to unforeseen circumstances, I made the decision to transition out of the military and pursue my dream of working in the healthcare field. I enrolled in a Medical Assistant program at PIMA Medical Institute in Seattle from 2021 to 2022 and was swiftly hired by Kaiser Permanente.
            <br>
            <br>    
            Now in 2023, I have embarked on a new journey to become a Software Developer at Code Fellows. 
            <br>
            Reflecting on my military career, I have undergone a significant transformation. I entered the Navy as an idealistic and caring individual but emerged with a hardened perspective, shaped by the challenges of being a woman in a predominantly male environment. Despite facing obstacles and having to prove myself repeatedly, I harbor no animosity and instead view my experiences as invaluable life lessons. I aim to utilize my knowledge and experiences to help others and serve as an inspiration for those facing similar struggles.</p>
